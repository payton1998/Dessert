# Dessert App

This is a simple solution to the [Coding Challenge](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/iOS+coding+exercise.pdf) of creating a 
dessert app from you all at the Fetch team. Some details to note, if you take a look at the code you can see that this was built with Model-View architecture, meaning that I 
seperated the backend logic from the View files. Also please note that I did not do much as far as designing the app since the prompt explicitly mentioned that design was not
really being evaluated here.
