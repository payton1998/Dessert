# Dessert App

This is a simple solution to the [Coding Challenge](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/iOS+coding+exercise.pdf) of creating a 
dessert app from you all at the Fetch team. Some details to note, if you take a look at the code you can see that this was built with Model-View architecture, meaning that I 
seperated the backend logic from the View files. Also please note that I did not do much as far as designing the app since the prompt explicitly mentioned that design was not
really being evaluated here. Also note that since I am still currently working full-time at Microsoft at the moment I did not have too much time to add more details to the app
but overall the logic of pulling data from the API is clean and just to note I also used Swift UI for this. This was actually my first time using Swift UI and there are many more 
improvements that I could have made here if I had more time. Some of these include testing, further expanding on the error handling and of course the design. I would love to be a 
part of your team and hope to hear back from you all!
